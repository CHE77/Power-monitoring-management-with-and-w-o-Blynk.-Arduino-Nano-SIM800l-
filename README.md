# Power-monitoring-management-with-and-w-o-Blynk.-Arduino-Nano-SIM800l-
   Power monitoring/management with and w/o Blynk. (Arduino Nano + SIM800l)    Via Blynk we set period of time when to switch off power (via relay) for Modem and Router and switch on again.    Blynk has bad habit to reset Nano if loose connection.    So, we will try to connect Blynk only is we already have gsm coverage and internet.    If it happens that Nano reboots and it could not connect to internet/Blynt it will    switch off and switch on relays ones a day according preset time at sketch.    Additionally Nano reads some sensors: smoke, flame, temperature and humidity,    check presets (with homemade modules) of AC and measure DC with voltage divider shield.    Sensors/Voltages readings go average before sending.
